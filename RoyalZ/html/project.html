  A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[8] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[9][10] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
  C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.
  Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.

  If you're seeking a companion MOOC course, try the ones from Udacity and Coursera (intro to programming [beginners] or intro to Python). Finally, if you're seeking self-paced online learning without watching videos, try the ones listed towards the end of this post — each feature learning content as well as a Python interactive interpreter you can practice with. What's this "interpreter" we mention? You'll find out in the next section!
  Language Introduction
  Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.
  An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreter and type code right into it. If you ever have a question like, "What happens if I add an int to a list?" Just typing it into the Python interpreter is a fast and likely the best way to see what happens.
